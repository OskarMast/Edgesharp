## Curriculum 
- Start with summary / look back since [previous brainstorm.](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/curriculum/blob/master/brainstorm-17May2017.md) 

### 15 minutes of short improvements
*Getting more people to finish the program successfully.*
- Laurens:  often classes get smaller as time progresses. From 12 to sometimes 4. Let in more people at the start. E.g. 20 people. Personal touch, quieter and slower students easy to lose. Maartje response: we can't find that many good students. Ideal number: 8
- Gijs/Maartje: we need to push more to hire good people.
- Daan: Is increasing demands from municipalities a threat to our program? with people only having 8 hours a week. 
- Ideas to improve: Laurens: get COA to recognize us. Mattijn: Combine classes with speaking Dutch. Iris: Relax criteria to enter, test is good, motivation thing not super important. Gijs: get more exposure. Jim: screen more for motivation. Philipp: get COA to cooperate more. Puigcerber: show case succes stories at events at municip. Maartje: add a "feedback" element to the onboarding process. Daan: get more specific exposure in specific channels. 
- Laurens suggestion for detecting drop out risk: Getting them to open up on their issues

### Next Year
- Dunno if enough students in 1 year. :(
- Ideas: Mattijn: open up to non-techie all people. Philipp: open up to non-refugees. Would like to teach still. Laurens: Become a ethical coder network.
