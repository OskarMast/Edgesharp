# Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Dear new student of HackYourFuture, 

Welcome to our program!

On average, we receive 100-200 applications for every new class. Therefore, to be accepted into HackYourFuture is a big accomplishment. 
You are now a member of a large community. 180+ students have graduated from HackYourFuture and more than 85% find a job as a professional web developer or software tester.

However, our course will be challenging. For the next 7 months there will be moments in which you might want to give up. It is important to remember that you are not the first to go through this. Many of our students, who are now in professional jobs, have at some point thought about quitting our course. Based on their experiences we compiled this guide to share the lessons learned: How do you make sure to be successful in HackYourFuture?

This guide consists of 3 chapters. In chapter 0 we lay out the foundation of the HYF organisation. In the second chapter, we provide a summary of our program. The final chapter focusses on what you can do to get through the course. 

Like you, this document is always improving. If you feel something is missing or might be improved, please let us know and we might add your suggestion.

Good luck on your journey! 

The HackYourFuture team

# Chapter 0: The Organization <a name="HYF"></a>

HackYourFuture was founded in 2016. We saw many talented people coming to the Netherlands as a refugee, but many had difficulty finding a job. At the same time the tech/IT sector is looking for talent to fill their open vacancies. That does not make any sense :) You can read more about the story of HYF on our website.

HYF is a foundation, which means we do not make a profit. However, we do make costs of course. Our program costs around EUR11.000 per graduate that finds a job, yet the education is free. How do we do this? Currently we receive most of our revenues from donations (60%) from large foundations like the ING Netherlands Fund, Stichting Doen and the Oranje Fonds. We also receive donations from companies and individuals (mostly former students). The rest of our revenues we receive through an education fee we ask to companies that hire our graduates.

One of the main strengths of our organisation is that we rely heavily on the contribution of our volunteers, all professional software developers and testers, that help to correct homework, teach classes and guide you through the program. Some of our graduates are now teaching at HackYourFuture! Currently, we have 4 paid employees on the payroll, together they form the core team of HYF.

[This RePo](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/culture) lays out our core values. These core values are leading for all of us involved in HackYourFuture: staff, alumni, students and teachers. They are leading in how we learn and teach and interact with each other. Please read them carefully. 

Also make sure to read and sign our code of conduct, you can find it [here](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/curriculum/blob/master/welcome.md). If you have any questions, feel free to ask them during introduction day. 

# Chapter 1: Course Overview <a name="course"></a>

During the next half year, you will practice with a variety of technologies and ways of thinking. This will build a solid foundation for you to become a junior web developer. What does this mean? 

At the end of the 7 months you will leave HackYourFuture with:
- The skills to build your own full-stack web applications
- Experience working in a team
- Access to the Alumni Network: a community of HackYourFuture graduates
- A decent CV and LinkedIn profile coupled with interview skills
- Introductions to companies looking to hire programmers or software testers

In order for this to be turned into reality, you will have to work very hard.
In the following section you will find an overview of all the subjects you’ll be learning about throughout the course. 

## 1.1 Curriculum <a name="curriculum"></a>
The 7 months are divided into different modules, each building on the one before. Here’s the [overview](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/curriculum).

However, there is no time to rest after graduation because the next challenge will be to find an internship (see also section 1.7). After you graduate it might take some time before you actually find an opportunity. That is why we have developed the [Post-Graduation Package](https://github.com/hackyourfuture/post-grad-ed). The PGP consists of additional technical projects that you will build to improve your skills and increase your chances of finding an internship.

## 1.2 Weekly program <a name="weekly"></a>
It is important to plan your week ahead of time, in order to work and study effectively (see also chapter 3: Study Strategies). In summary your study week for HackYourFuture is as follows:

|Day               | Activity                                                                         |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Wednesday-Thursday|Video lecture + Readings for this week                                            |
|Friday-Saturday   |Work on the homework assignment + Submit question for the Q&A session             |
|Sunday            |Q&A Session 12-3pm (usually ends earlier)                                         |
|Monday-Tuesday    |Finish homework (deadline Tuesday 23:59) + Implement feedback on previous homework|

The video lectures are included in the curriculum on GutHub. (you can also find them on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkK246iKcOAvsL0SI_6n3eA)). In these lectures, one of our teachers explains the core concepts of this week and provides you  examples and exercises.

You are also asked to do the homework assignments and readings (see next section). On Tuesday you have to submit your homework and on Saturday at least one question before the Question and Answer (Q&A) session on Sunday. The Q&A session is an online meeting where the teacher will answer your questions, so please come prepared! He/she might also ask you questions. Submitting homework and Q&A’s are mandatory! 

Currently, due to Corona all of our education is online. In the near future we hope to go back to face-to-face classes on Sunday.

## 1.3 Homework <a name="homework"></a>
As mentioned, our complete curriculum can be found on Github. The modules are ordered sequentially. The homework can be found in the module repository. For example, if you click on [HTML-CSS](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/HTML-CSS) you’ll be taken to the document that has all the information about that particular module. If you scroll down you’ll see a table with a column Homework.
![alt text](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/curriculum/blob/master/assets/html:css-table.png)

After the first couple of weeks, Github will also be where you will publish your homework. In the beginning you might struggle to use Github. But there is a reason we use it: It is the number 1 platform for programmers! In order to become a good programmer, you will have to understand how Github works. You will notice that after a few weeks, finding the right homework assignments and reading, as well as publishing your homework on Github, will become automatic. 

Most weeks you will have homework assignments and we expect you to finish them before Wednesday. Not handing in homework without proper communication will not be tolerated (see also our values and our 3 strike policy).

### 1.3.1 Review process
All of your homework will be reviewed by one of our mentors in a very similar way code reviews happen in any company you are going to work at. The homework pull requests you create every week will go through the following process:

1. Initially the `Needs review` label is set.
2. When the mentor starts reviewing, the label `Review in progress` is added.
3. Once they are done the mentor decides if the homework is good enough or some work is still needed. If the homework is good enough, the issue will receive the `Approved` label. If not, the label `Reviewed with feedback` will be set.
4. The student looks at the feedback and corrects their homework. Once finished, the label `Needs review` is set again. We then go back to step 2.

So if an issue is assigned to a student with the `Reviewed with feedback` label, that means the student needs to work on it. If an issue has the label `Needs review` it means it is for the mentor to look at. In the end all issues should get the `Approved` label! 

It is the student's responsibility to make sure the pull request gets to the `Approved` state and make fixing the feedback your top priority when you get it. It can happen that it takes a little while for our mentors to pick up the homework (they do have full time jobs after all), but if there is no review yet on the Q&A day then please contact your class mentor so they can see if someone else is available to pick it up.

### 1.3.2 Note on copying
You will probably hear at some point at HYF that programmers copy and paste code into their applications all the time. While this is true, during your studies we want you to really think about how to solve something before aking google to help out. The exercises are made to be doable, but solutions to them are probably easy to find online as we want to teach you practical things which you may need in the future. If you just copy code from google you will not learn as much and it will show in your test interviews or, even worse, during your internship.

There are occasions where you will copy code from the internet. In such a case, the following criteria apply:
1. A reference is given (in a comment)
2. Don't copy code from fellow students
3. It must be clear which code is copied
4. The functionality of the code is explained in the comment. This means you are sure you understand what the code does that you copied.

The last one is most important there, do *not* ever put anything into your codebase that you do not understand.

If we notice that you copied code without applying the rules above, we see that as plagiarism. In any case of fraud or plagiarism, you’re out of HYF. 

## 1.4 Tests <a name="tests"></a>
At HackYourFuture the material is mostly selfstudy and our lectures are taught by many different mentors. This means that we can’t follow the progress of every student during class. But, (1.)we're interested in your progress and your level of understanding. So, We use tests. 
Three other important reasons why we have integrated them in our curriculum:  
2. You have the time to go over all the concepts again and make sure you understand them well.
3. We can indicate who needs a bit more guidance throughout the curricum and to make sure that the class is on the same page.
4. We can promise a certain level of understanding of the concepts in our curriculum to our partners. 

**General rules for the tests:**
- You can only enter the project once you have a 6 or higher for every test (except the Browsers test).
- In any case of fraud or plagiarism, you’re out of HYF. 
- Don’t share the questions and/or answers of your tests with students from other classes. We see this as fraud.
- You are not allowed to have contact with other people during the test. 

**Grading system:** 
- The lowest grade is a 1.
- The highest grade is a 10.
- A 6 is sufficient
- Every grade lower than a 6 is not sufficient.

|**Module** (test description)       | **Less than a 6**        | **6 or higher**   |
|------------------|------------------ |------------------ |
|**Javascript** (good old-fashioned test)|You receive extra support during Browsers & Using API’s from a mentor |Cool, you understand the core concepts of javascript!|
|**Browsers** (Group project + individual interview)|You receive extra support during Using API’s from a mentor|You can handle yourself in a group and understand how to make basic JavaScript websites.|
|**Using API's** (Individual project + individual interview)|Based on previous results, the HYF team will decide if it is best to take a break and rejoin the next class or if this is the end of the road at HackYourFuture.|You can handle vanilla JavaScript frontend applications for public API’s. Time to go onto the backend!|
|**Node.js** (Video/presentation about a project)|Continue with your class, but redo the Node.js test before you start the project.|Your explanation of the project is according to our expectations!|
|**React** (building a small React application)|Based on previous results, the HYF team will decide if it is best to take a break and rejoin the next class or if this is the end of the road at HackYourFuture.| Ready for the project!|
|**Final Project** (Tech interview based on project)|Based on previous results, the HYF team will decide if it is best to do a fellowship or post graduation package exercise before applying to companies.|Ready for your first job!|

We know that there is a life outside of HYF and that life sometimes gets in the way so whenever a decision is made we try to take these factors into consideration. That means that consequences listed in the table above are not set in stone as we try to find what is best for the student.

## 1.5 Teachers <a name="teachers"></a>
HackYourFuture is only possible because of our amazing team of teachers. Our teachers are medior and senior software developers working at small and big companies. Some of them are even graduates from our program! They usually have very busy jobs and they sacrifice their limited free time to help you to become a developer, so  e ask you to respect and value their time by preparing yourself for class!

That does not mean that you shouldn't ask extra questions. Make as much use of this valuable resource as you can. Our teachers are happiest when the classes are lively and the students get into discussions about code and concepts of programming. Having this weekly options to ask anything you are struggling with is what makes our program so much more successful than following a course on your own.

## 1.6 Q&A sessions <a name="sessions"></a>
The content of the Q&A sessions is decided by you. Based on your questions the mentor will explain the concepts that aren’t clear yet. In order to make the sessions as useful as possible we have implemented the following rules: 
* Submit your question(s) in the thread on the message that will be posted in your class channel. This is part of the homework. If you can’t think of a question, search online for a small exercise to do together during the Q&A session. Message your class mentor before the deadline if you are not able to submit a question/exercise.  
Examples of both good and bad questions:
Good:		_"Do callbacks have to do with asynchronicity in our applications?"_
Bad:		_"Can you explain again what a callback is?"_
* Be on time, turn your camera on, and your microphone off. If you have a poor internet connection let Tjebbe know so we can find a solution together.
* Participate actively. Answer if a teacher has a yes/no question. These sessions are a dialoge so it's a shared responisbility to make it interactive.
* Ask additional questions and speak up when it's not clear. (it is crucial not to wait and hope things get better with time. As the speed of our curriculum is very high, you have to take initiative and reach out to us for HELP. Again, good programmers ask for help. Those that do not ask for help, will never become good programmers.)
* Be ready to answer questions yourself. The teacher will be active in asking YOU to explain concepts. This is not to embarrass you but to help you practice the skills you will need when working at a real company.

## 1.7 Teaching Location <a name="location"></a>
> Note: Because of the Corona crisis, we are currently conducting all of our classes online. 
> We will explain this in more detail during the introduction day. As a result some of the information in this section is more relevant for when we return to face-to-face classes.

For our main teaching day on Sunday, we make use of the office of Backbase, one of HackYourFuture’s most important partners. The office is located at Sarphatistraat 370. We are incredibly lucky as we can use this location for free.

However there are few rules and regulations that are very important to take into consideration. _Failure to comply with them could lead to your dismissal from the HYF program._ 

1. Door policy  
The doors downstairs (main entrance), should be closed at **all times**. We will make sure to have someone open the door at the beginning of the day (usually from 11:30 until 12 when class starts). If you arrive later, please ask for someone to open door using the #door channel in Slack.

> Slack is a communication tool we use within HackYourFuture. After the introduction day we will send you an invitation link to download the software.

If you want to go outside during the break for some fresh air or to smoke, please use the door at the back of the building. You are only allowed to smoke in the designated areas. Also this door should be closed at all times! If not, the private security company will be automatically alerted and we have a lot of explaining to do.

2. Chairs and tables  
If you are borrowing chairs from outside the meeting rooms during the day, you should put them exactly where taken from. Some Backbase-employees have the height of their chairs customised and find it very difficult to find them back if they were returned somewhere else. If you are using any desk space, please make sure that any chargers or monitors used/removed are put back as they were before. Please do not use any chargers that do not belong to you unless given permission by staff members.

3. Cleaning  
Please clean up after yourself. After lunch you should clean the breadcrumbs and coffee stains. Also, clean up the floor in the bathroom. If you need to wash yourself before and/or after praying, bring a towel.

4. Windows  
During class windows may be opened. However, please check after class if windows have been closed.

5. After class   
We often go for drinks after class. We believe that HackYourFuture is not just about learning but also about building connections, friendships and socializing. Feel free to join, the first round is on us :) We usually go for drinks at Crea or Kriterion, two nearby cafes. Note: do make sure to take care of your belongings (backpack and coat). In the past we have had one case of theft.

## 1.8 Three Strike Policy <a name="strike"></a>
We maintain a simple 3 strike policy. You get 1 strike in the following situations:
- You are not present in the lecture without proper communication and valid reason 
- You do not hand in the homework in time without proper communication and valid reason
- You do not implement feedback on your homework without proper communication and valid reason
- You do not submit a question in time for the Question & Answer session on Sunday
- You do not follow any additional instructions we ask you to follow (e.g. showing up for a practice interview, update your CV/Linkedin, etc.)

Once you have 3 strikes, we will re-evaluate your participation in HYF.

## 1.9 Start your career <a name="career"></a>
After graduation, it is time to find an internship. This internship almost always leads to a paid job. HackYourFuture will do its best to find suitable companies for you, as we have an extensive network of partner companies. However, finding work will depend also on your efforts:

1. Is 'Your Personal Brand' ready?
Is your CV, GitHub and LinkedIn profiles up to date and following the given guidelines? Have you asked for feedback from the Partnership Manager? Do you continue to update your CV with new projects and experiences? For more information on this, visit ['Your Personal Brand Repo'](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/yourpersonalbrand)

2. Are you ready for job interviews? 
During the course you will have career training sessions where we will discuss the basics of finding an internship, how to prepare for interviews, what companies expect from HackYourFuture graduates, etc. Additionaly, you will have many mockup interviews (aka practice interviews), both technical and social. These interviews will be conducted by the HYF core-team and by recruiters from our partner company Adyen. After each interview, you will receive feedback about your performance and things you can improve upon. This will make you less nervous and prepare you for real interviews with companies! To learn more about this, please visit the ['Interview Preparation' Repo](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/interviewpreparation).

3. Revise what you've learned and never stop learning new things!
One of the biggest risks to starting your career is to stop coding after graduation. This will significantly decrease your chances of finding an internship. We highly recommend you continue to work on projects even right after graduation. These projects will help you learn even further and you can also add them to your CV to show companies you never stop learning! A good way to go about this is by working on the [Post Graduation Package](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/post-grad-ed). Also, be sure to revise all concepts studied throughout the course as this might come in handy when doing technical or social interviews. 

4. Remember the Education Fee!
When a company hires one of our gradyates, we ask for an education fee. This fee, helps us fund the next class of students. Once a company hires you, we ask them for 350 euros per month during the internship time, and 3000 euros minus the fees paid for the internship once thy hire you for a full-time job. This fee is never more than 3000 total and it does not come out of your pay. Think of this as a recruiting fee paid by the company + a way for having those companies supporting our mission of helping people like you start a career in tech. It might happen that you find a job by yourself at a company that is not partnering yet with HackYourFuture. If that is the case, we still ask you to Remember about the Education Fee and to connect with HYF's partnership manager as early as possible in the hiring process to best inform the company about that.

IMPORTANT: Once you graduate, connect with HackYourFuture's partnership manager to have a personalised plan to get an internship as soon as possible!

## 1.10 Paying it forward <a name="donations"></a>

As mentioned, HackYourFuture is a not-for-profit organisation. Our program costs around EUR11.000 per graduate that finds a job, yet is free of charge for our students.  Currently we receive most of our revenues from donations (70%) from large foundations like the ING Netherlands Fund, Stichting Doen and the Oranje Fonds. The rest of our revenues we receive through an education fee we ask to companies that hire our graduates.

In the coming years we have to find a business model in which we are less reliant on foundations as their funding is temporary. We are currently exploring partnerships with companies for donations. We are also exploring an alumni donation scheme. Students who graduate and find a job can donate (voluntarily) a monthly amount to make sure the next generation of students is being trained. Please contact us if you are interested.

# Chapter 2: How to study programming (tips for non-programmers) <a name="study"></a>

Through our years of experience guiding non-programmers into the world of programming we have gathered some common roadblocks/issues/misconceptions that we would like to inform you about so you don't run into the same thing.

## 2.1. Reading error messages <a name="error"></a>
When programming you will deal with a lot of errors and being able to find how to solve them is the core of what a programmer does. As a beginner these error messages can seem daunting, however, and we often see our students ignoring the information that would help them solve the problem. Let's look at the following error message from some JavaScript code:

```
TypeError: res.status is not a function
    at Server.<anonymous> (C:\Users\Rob\hyf\Node.js\week1\homework\exercises\3-web-server\server.js:26:9)
    at Server.emit (events.js:315:20)
    at parserOnIncoming (_http_server.js:874:12)
    at HTTPParser.parserOnHeadersComplete (_http_common.js:126:17)
```

There is a lot of information in there to try to help you identify what is going on, but much of it is probably not needed to solve this issue. Let's disect this information:

```
TypeError: res.status is not a function
```

The first line is generally a good place to start. This one is short, but sometimes these can get quite large. The first part tells you the type of error (in this case a `TypeError`) which doesn't help us much here. After that it is the message a developer wants to tell you, in this case `res.status is not a function`. This is the part the developer fills in when you throw an error from your code. If the developer was nice this should give you all the information you need. In this case there is some code somewhere that tries to call the function `status` on a variable called `res` that does not seem to be a function.

The rest of the error message is what we call the call stack:

```
  at Server.<anonymous> (C:\Users\Rob\hyf\Node.js\week1\homework\exercises\3-web-server\server.js:26:9)
  at Server.emit (events.js:315:20)
  at parserOnIncoming (_http_server.js:874:12)
  at HTTPParser.parserOnHeadersComplete (_http_common.js:126:17)
```

This should tell you where in the code it broke. We will go into more detail about this in the curriculum, but the rule here is to look for a filename / directory that you recognise. In this case the first line `at Server.<anonymous> (C:\Users\Rob\hyf\Node.js\week1\homework\exercises\3-web-server\server.js:26:9)` is a file on my computer that I recognize. The numbers at the end `26:9` tells you at what line (26) and character in that line (9) your code broke. So now you know where to start looking for a problem!

## 2.2 Finding solutions online <a name="solution"></a>
If you can't figure out the error yourself then it is time to search online. When it comes to programming, the internet is filled with solutions that may or may not work. Some information will be out of date as well. This means that it may take multiple attempts to find the solution you need. When looking for a problem we have a couple of tips:

- Include the language you are programming in / library where the error occured
- Copy paste the error description (`res.status is not a function`) into your search engine
- If there are too many results, add a time filter in your search engine
- After a while you will find out which sites provide good information. For example:
  - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). This is an up to date and clear resource of information!
  - [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). The place where many questions are asked and answered.

## 2.3 Asking for help when stuck <a name="stuck"></a>
Let's say even the internet cannot help you, it is then time to ask your class for help. There is a right and wrong way to ask for help though. We regularly see students send a message that looks something like this:

```
Hi class, I get an error when running my server, anyone else ran into this problem too?
```

This is not very helpful and will probably not get a lot of response. The reason is that there is no information which means any other students will not be able to know if the error is indeed the same. The best thing to do is to take a screenshot of or copy the error message and post it there. That way your classmates will already know if it is something they recognize. For example:

```
Hi class, I get the following error when running my server for Node week 3 exercise 3:

TypeError: res.status is not a function
    at Server.<anonymous> (C:\Users\Rob\hyf\Node.js\week1\homework\exercises\3-web-server\server.js:26:9)
    at Server.emit (events.js:315:20)
    at parserOnIncoming (_http_server.js:874:12)
    at HTTPParser.parserOnHeadersComplete (_http_common.js:126:17)
```

## 2.4 Code as much as possible <a name="code"></a>
We provide a lot of reading materials/videos in the curriculum, but you will learn the most when you are coding yourself. At the start of the week we introduce you to new concepts, this will give you new ideas and tools to work with. But no video will be able to explain something in such a short time for you to get it, that will only come through practice.

So treat the reading materials as a way of introducing you to new ideas, then apply those ideas to your code as much as possible. You can even copy the code the video uses and play around with it, it will make you understand it so much better than just watching others do it.

## 2.5 Minimize distractions <a name="distractions"></a>
The goal whilst studying should be to reach a state of ‘flow’. Flow can be described as the complete immersion in an activity. By doing so, you lose your sense of space and time. There is quite some research about ‘flow’. This research shows that not only your learning curve increases significantly, also the level of joy increases. In other words, if you are fully concentrated whilst programming you feel way more satisfied as a result. 

To reach this level of optimal concentration and create a state of flow, distractions should be shut out as much as possible. The two most common enemies are described below.

**Challenge number 1: Social Media & Phone**  
Social media is incredibly bad for your focus and therefore it decreases your ability to learn complex concepts. In order to understand programming concepts your brain needs full focus. Every time it is interrupted by a phone or a message online, your brain has to switch its attention. To go back to your code after that will cost a lot of energy. In fact, [studies have shown that just having a phone in the same room](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/691462), reduces your ability to study significantly. 

We highly recommend you: when you are studying, put your phone away and use your study time for studying only.
Another app that can help you out: [Selfcontrol.](https://selfcontrolapp.com/) A bit of a contradiction, but it blocks the websites that distract you for the period that you want to be focussed.

**Challenge number 2: Children and family**  
Many of us are not living by ourselves. You might have children, or family members asking for attention. The challenge here is to try and create a quiet space, where you will not be interrupted. Of course, this is not always possible if you are a parent. But perhaps you can ask your partner or a friend to keep an eye on your children at least for a few hours a day, while you go to a local library, or study in a quiet room at a friend’s house. 

## 2.6 Life happens <a name="life"></a>
At HackYourFuture we know we expect a lot. You are learning things that many of our teachers spent 5 years studying in a fraction of that time. You will need to devote a huge part of your life to the curriculum in a usually less than ideal learning environment. Sometimes life will get in the way of this and there is no shame in admitting that you need help.

We are here to assist in any way we can, please let your class mentor know as soon as things get too much or something happens that will mean you won't be able to put in the time and/or effort that is needed. There are many ways we can help you out, either by providing some extra support from a mentor or from a life coach or by giving you a break. We want you to succeed and letting us know what is going on beforehand will always work out better for all of us. We are working towards the same goal!

# Final thoughts <a name="thoughts"></a>

As of March 2021, over 180 students graduated from our program. Over 85% are working in the IT sector, within three months after graduation. In other words, HackYourFuture works. 

However, throughout your HYF course and your career as a programmer, you will control your own fate. 

40 hours of study is just the minimum we suggest. The more you know and the harder you work, the faster you will find yourself in a job you love. The more you participate and become part of the HYF community, the more people are going to be willing to help you out. The more friends you make.

We want to provide you with the knowledge, tools and support you need to build a career as a programmer. To support yourself and your loved ones. 

We are glad to have you on board!

The HYF Team
