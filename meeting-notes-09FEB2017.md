* Sharing responsibility by two teachers who are teaching the same module: One teaches, other monitors homeworks, gives feedback etc.
* Continuous feedback/follow-up system with Slack
* Learn them to learn themselves: Encourage reading a book chapter / watching a video before they come to the class.
* Struture the contents of every course/module so that teachers have clear picture of what to teach / how much to cover.
- Use Git repositories (like https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Git) to define expectations.
- Use Git repositories to write course contents/ share material, tutorial links, video links (So that it's all in one place)
