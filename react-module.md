Due to the big use of react with flux like state manager I think we should cover one library(mobx, redux, ...). Redux is the most popular but mobx is much easy to use and reduce the amount of boilerplate/manual work. For this reason I consider it as the best tool to teach because it will let us more time to focus in react and unidirectional data flow concepts. Also switching from mobx is relatively very easy.
