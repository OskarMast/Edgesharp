# HackYourFuture Curriculum

> Here you can find an overview of the HackYourFuture program. It gives insight in how our program is structured, organized, what you can expect from the modules that we teach and last but not least where we teach and where you can find support during the week. Our half year course is divided into modules that last 3 weeks with exception of the project module that lasts 6 weeks. Below you can find a short listing of the contents and deliverables/learning goals of the different modules. The headers of the different modules link to the actual repositories that are used by teachers to post assignments/reading materials etc. Be aware that some of the modules make use of more than one repository.

> Welcome to the wonderful world of web development! In this module you will learn the basic building blocks of the web: HTML and CSS. HTML gives us the power to add text, images and videos to a page. CSS gives us the power to organize these parts and make it look nice. The products of HTML and CSS comprise a two-thirds of what is called frontend (the final third is client-side JavaScript, which you will learn about in later modules). What is frontend? It's another word for the presentational part of a piece of software. In terms of web development we're talking about "what you see" when you go to any website. Think of it like this: if a webpage were a person, the HTML would be the skeleton and CSS the skin and clothing! You'll also be learning GIT, software that will allow you to save your folders and files in case they accidentally get deleted or end up corrupt. It can do much more and you'll learn all about that starting from week 2!

### **Module goals**

- Be able to write syntactically correct HTML and CSS
- Understand what is meant by "responsive" web development
- Practice navigation your computer using the command line interface (CLI)
- Learn about GIT and its basic usage
- Become familiar with Trello and GitHub as a way to submit your homework
- Explain your code by presenting what you've done
- Know your way around Visual Studio Code
- Feel comfortable working with your browser's inspector

| 3    | [Node](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Node.js) | [Details](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Node.js/tree/master/week3) |

> Node.js is a server-side platform built on Google Chrome's JavaScript Engine (V8 Engine). For almost any web application, it is essential to have a backend. The backend is a place where we, the developers, can store our data, communicate with users and let the users communicate with us, do smart things like calculations, data processing etc.

There are many languages for this. We might've heard of Java, C, C++, Go, Python, Ruby, PHP and the [list goes on](https://blog.newrelic.com/2016/08/18/popular-programming-languages-2016-go/).

There are two reasons why we at HYF choose Node.JS over others:

1. You already know JavaScript, so it's easier to get started than other languages
2. Node.js is great for making web APIs because it is asynchronous by nature and thus allows for high input/output. By this we mean that it allows many users to make very light requests at the same time.

### **What will we learn?**

- What is Node.js?
- Using Node Package Manager (NPM)
- Using `require` to include modules
- Using `http` to handle http requests and respond
- Using `fs` to read from and write to files.
- Using `process` to read arguments from the CLI
- Using `express` to make a RESTful API

## [Database](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/databases)

> In this module we will learn about databases using MySQL.

| Week | Topic                                                           | Details                                                                  |

| 3    | [Database design](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/databases)  | [Details](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/databases/tree/master/Week3) |

> What is a database? A place to store “things”. Could be as simple as a phone book (physical) or as complex as storing all the inventory for Amazon.com. Why use databases? Easier than having data all over the place. Puts the problem of collecting, storing, sorting and searching data in a single place. There are two primary types of database systems - relational and NoSQL. Relational databases have tables that relate to one another and can be “joined” ACID vs BASE

### **Module goals**

By the end of this module, students should have a familiarity with and basic understanding of the following:

- Entities
- The relational model
- The Structured Query Language (SQL)
- The construction of a database system
- MySQL as an example of a relational database system
- Non-relational data and NoSQL
- MongoDB as an example of a NoSQL database

## [React](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/React)

> In this module we will learn about React.

| Week | Topic                                                          | Details                                                                                              |
