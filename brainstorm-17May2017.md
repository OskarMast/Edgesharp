# Brainstorm session 17 May 2017

To see the notes of what we discussed last time please check [Unmesh's notes](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/curriculum/blob/master/meeting-notes-09FEB2017.md)

### Today:

- We have two employers joining us to talk about their experience working with our students
- We have three graduated students dropping by to tell us about their experiences working/doing an internship after graduating HYF.

### Evaluate 
- We would like to look back since the last session what has been done since then. What has changed?
    + There is an _hopefully_ clear overview of the [HYF curriculum](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/curriculum).
    + All Modules are linked in there and module goals have been added to give students and teachers a good idea about what is expected from them to teach/know at the end of every module.
    + All students now have to prepare before they come to class with reading material or a video. This is also documented in the module repositories
    + We are working on recording all our classes (links in the repo's as well) and posting it on YouTube.
    + There is an [Alumni Wiki](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/alumni/wiki) that tells you step by step how to land your first developer job (optimize your CV, how to prepare for an interview etc.). 
    + We've had two Masterclasses/Alumni sessions (Security event and the Datastrcutures class that is going on now) since the last meeting.
    + For the last few months Erol and Natan have been working with some of the Alumni on the [Generala App](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/generala). An project that Alumni (with or without a job) can join to improve their skill set. 
    + We've done (tech)interview training with Martijn, Tim and Walla to prepare our students before they go into actual interviews (we still need to evaluate this with the students who did this).
    + Feedback after every module from students on quality of teaching/module content

### Future work
- What we are currently working on:
    + Slack bot for administrative, feedback, test purposes.
    + Clear teaching vision
    + Clear profile graduated HYF students

- What else can we improve?
- What are your ideas where HYF should focus on in the coming year?
    Things to keep in mind:
    + We have to keep on finding good candidates (this could be an issue)
    + We want to keep the value of the community/team
    + We want to keep the value of the content/curriculum that we created
