# HYF core values

## Learning
* Our program is about problem solving and learning how to learn.
* Take responsibility for your own learning process.
* Tell us and your fellow students what works for you and what doesn't when it comes to learning.
* Be active and communicate about things that are not clear.
* Help us and our teachers improve by giving regular feedback.
* There is a lot of room for struggling/not understanding, there is no room for people who do nothing.

## Community
* Volunteers, they are here on their free Sundays, while they could be with their families and friends. Respect their time. Value their time. Give them energy and motivate them. 
* You are now part of our community. Think about how you would like to contribute to the community. What do you have to offer? What can you teach us?
* Your team (aka your class).  Doing HYF all alone is merely impossible. Help out your team mates, motivate each other, be strict to each other. Find out why you are all here in this room together. As a team you have a responsibility toward us and mostly towards your teachers. Again, value and respect their time. Motivate them when they need it, help them out as well.

## In short, your responsibilities inside HYF:
* Take ownership for your own learning process.
* Communicate.
* Give us and our teachers feedback on how we can improve.
* Value your own time. We take you seriously, take yourself seriously as well.
* Respect our volunteer teachers.
* Be a team, help each other out.
* Work hard, Google and ask questions.
